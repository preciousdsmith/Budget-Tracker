# Budget-Tracker
To use the Budget application, simply input your income and expenses, then calculate the remaining budget. First, enter your income amount in the designated field and click the "Add Income" button to add it to the total. Next, input your expenses and click the "Add Expense" button to add them. After entering all your values, click the "Calculate Budget" button to see the difference between your total income and expenses, which will be displayed as the remaining budget. The application ensures that all inputs are valid numbers and alerts you if any field is empty or contains invalid data.
